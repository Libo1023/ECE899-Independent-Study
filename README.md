**models.py** contains all optimizable modules/layers of the two-level zoom-in network.  

**utilities.py** contains all customized helper functions for data preprocessing and network optimization/evaluation.  

**train.py** contains detailed implementations of how to optimize and evaluate the two-level zoom-in network.  

**main.ipynb** instantiates and calls all the above components to conduct network training and validation on GPU.
